## **My Answer**

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy

        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                current.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                current.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            current = current.next
        current.next = list1 if list1 else list2
        
        return dummy.next
```

### **Solution**  

#### **Approach**
Use a dummy pointer to point the next node as the head. 

#### **Code Explanation**
1. Create a dummy node that will not be included in the actual code. It's just there to simplify the process.
2. Initialize a pointer `current` to keep track of the current node of the list. 
3. Loop while list1 and list2 are not empty: Compare the values of the current nodes of list 1 and list2. 
4. If current value of current node in list1 is less than / equal to that of list2, append the current node of list1 to the merged list and move list1 pointer to the next node. 
5. Otherwise, append the current node of list2 and move list2 pointer to the next node.
6. Append remaining nodes to the end of the list and return the head node which is the next node after the dummy node.
